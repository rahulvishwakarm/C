1. Queue is a data structure in for storing data
2. Queue is the data structure in which insertion is done from one end called rare end
    deletion is done from another end called front end .
3. First element to be inserted to be deleted first, hence called FIFO
4. When the element is inserted into queue it is called Enquee
5. When the element is deleted from the queue it is called Dequee
6. Process of Removing element from empty queue results in Underflow
7. Process of Inserting element Into empty element results in Overflow

Queue ADT:
a. Main Queue Operation
- EnQueue(int data)
- DeQueue()

b. Auxiliary Operation
- int Front()
- int QueueSize()
- int IsEmptyQueue()

Ways to Implement Queue:
1. Using Array
2. Using Linked List
